## OVERVIEW OF PROJECT

  
### PURPOSE
      
  The purpose of this project was to reffactor an Excel VBA code to collect certain stock information in 2017 and 2018 to determine whether or not the stocks are worth investing for our client Steve after preparing the workbook for him. 

The data presented is two charts with stock information on twelve different stocks. The stock information contains ticker value, the date the stock was issued. the opening, closing and adjusted volume price, the highest and lowest price, and the volume of the stock. The goal of this project was to retrieve the ticker, total daily volume, and return on each stock. 
    
### **RESULTS**

In order to complete this project, refactoring the code was necessary. Using the code given to us in a VBS file I created the edits needed in order to successfully run the code. Below is a photo of the original code and refactored code.

## **Summary**

### Pros and Cons of Refactoring Code

The pros of refactoring code are: improved code readability, it improvevs design software anad helps find bugs faster. Having a cleaner code makes it more readable and organized for the writer as well as the reader. Disadvantages of code refactoring is that it is time consuoming and risky if the application is too big. 


## The Advantages of Refactoring in Stock Analysis

The biggest benefit of refactoring for this project was a shorter macro run time. The original analysis took one about second to run whereas the refactored analysis took about one fourth of the time.
